# Banking API
Hello and welcome to my banking API. This is simple application for performing common banking transactions.
It includes the basic CRUD operations for clients and accounts as well as endpoints for depositing, withdrawing, and transfering money.

I created the first iteration of this app during my coding bootcamp as a complete beginner. That first draft was done in pure Java and although it worked, the code was
quite ugly and incomplete. I decided to refactor the application using the Spring framework and buffed it out to include better input validation and testing. My hope for this project is to display my coding skills in Java and Spring and my understanding of testing (both unit and integration). I also tried to follow RESTful princples when constructing my endpoints.

The project is very basic at the moment. In order to use the app all that you would need to do is pull the code from Github and run the project locally. All endpoints can be tested through Postman. In the future I hope to put together a simple UI.

Going forward, I plan on building the project out to include some additional features. I'd like to integrate a messaging system such as RabbitMQ that would send confirmation emails when a transaction is made. I don't have much experience working with messaging queues and I think this would be a great way to jump in. As mentioned above, I'll also be working on a UI.

Thanks so much for taking the time to look at my application!
